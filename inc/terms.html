<h2>1. Your use of Zygote Body</h2>
<p>1.1 Your use of Zygote Body's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Zygote under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Zygote. "Zygote" means Zygote Media Group, Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1045 S. 500 E. #200, American Fork, Utah, 84003, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Zygote, your agreement with Zygote will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the "Universal Terms".</p>
<p>1.3 Your agreement with Zygote will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the "Additional Terms". Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>
<p>1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Zygote Body in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the "Terms".</p>
<p>1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>
<h2>2. Accepting the Terms</h2>
<p>2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>
<p>2.2 You can accept the Terms by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Zygote in the user interface for any Service; or</li>
  <li>(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Zygote will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Zygote Body, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</p>
<p>2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.</p>
<h2>3. Language of the Terms</h2>
<p>3.1 Where Zygote has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Zygote Body.</p>
<p>3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
<h2>4. Provision of the Services by Zygote</h2>
<p>4.1 Zygote has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world ("Subsidiaries and Affiliates"). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Zygote itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</p>
<p>4.2 Zygote is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Zygote provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Zygote may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Zygote's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Zygote when you stop using the Services.</p>
<p>4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Zygote disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.</p>
<p>4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Zygote may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Zygote at any time, at Zygote's discretion.</p>
<h2>5. Use of the Services by you</h2>
<p>5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Zygote will always be accurate, correct and up to date.</p>
<p>5.2 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).</p>
<p>5.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Zygote, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Zygote.

<p>5.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).</p>
<p>5.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Zygote, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.</p>
<p>5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Zygote has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Zygote may suffer) of any such breach.</p>
<h2>6. Privacy and your personal information</h2>
<p>6.1 When you use the Services, you may provide some information about yourself to Zygote.

<h2>7. Content in the Services</h2>
<p>7.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, audio files, photographs, videos, or images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content".</p>
<p>7.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to Zygote (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Zygote or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>7.3 Zygote reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. The Services include content intended for educational and medical purposes, including anatomical data of reproductive anatomy that may or may not be suited for all audiences. By using the Services, you agree to assume full risk and responsibility for your exposure to any or all Content to which you may gain access. </p>
<h2>8. Proprietary rights</h2>
<p>8.1 You acknowledge and agree that Zygote (or Zygote's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). </p>
<p>8.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Zygote, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Zygote's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.</p>
<p>8.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Zygote, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement.</p>
<p>8.4 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.</p>
<p>8.5 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Zygote, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.</p>
<h2>9. License from Zygote</h2>
<p>9.1 Zygote gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Zygote as part of the Services as provided to you by Zygote (referred to as the "Software" below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Zygote, in the manner permitted by the Terms.</p>
<p>9.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Zygote, in writing.</p>
<p>9.3 Unless Zygote has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.</p>
<h2>10. Software updates</h2>
<p>10.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from Zygote. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, promote new software modules and completely new versions.

<h2>11. Ending your relationship with Zygote</h2>
<p>11.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by Zygote as set out below.</p>
<p>11.2 Zygote may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</li>
  <li>(B) Zygote is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or</li>
  <li>(C) the partner with whom Zygote offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with Zygote or ceased to offer the Services to you; or</li>
  <li>(D) Zygote is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or</li>

</ul>
<p>11.3 Nothing in this Section shall affect Zygote's rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of the Terms.</p>
<p>11.4 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Zygote have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 17.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.</p>

<h2>16. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>16.1 Zygote may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, Zygote will make a new copy of the Universal Terms and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.</p>

<p>17.4 You agree that if Zygote does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Zygote has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Zygote's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Zygote.</p>
<p>17.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.

Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>17.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Zygote under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Zygote agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Utah, Utah to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Zygote shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.<br>
